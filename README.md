# Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineering-Project
This is Microsoft Fabrics Bing Data Analysis Full End-to-End Data-Engineering-project.
##### This project is Inspired from Youtube Here is the Link : https://youtu.be/yHU9ADk10eQ?si=GEjVfMy9DWDOhSdC
### The Topics covered in this Project 

 ##### 1. Data Ingestion from Bing API using Data Factory: Learn how to seamlessly pull in data from external sources, setting the foundation for your analytics project.
 ##### 2. Data Transformation using Synapse Data Engineering: Dive into the process of shaping and refining your raw JSON data to a curated Delta Table, including techniques like incremental loading to keep your processes efficient.
 ##### 3. Sentiment Analysis using Synapse Data Science: Uncover insights hidden within the news description by predicting the sentiment of the news classified as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
 ##### 4. Orchestration using Data Factory via pipelines: Discover the art of orchestrating your data workflows, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
 ##### 5. Data Reporting using Power BI: Visualize your data in a compelling and actionable manner, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights.
 ##### 6. Configuring Alerts using the Data Activator: Stay ahead of potential issues by setting up alerts and notifications within your Power BI visuals using a new tool called Data Activator.
 ##### 7. End to End Pipeline Testing: The complete flow will be tested right from the data ingestion to the data transformation and until the report gets updated with the incoming new data to Validate the integrity and performance of your pipelines, ensuring reliability and accuracy.
#### This project revolves around Bing News Data Analytics, a practical application that involves ingesting news data daily and generating insightful reports. By walking through each step in a simplified manner.
